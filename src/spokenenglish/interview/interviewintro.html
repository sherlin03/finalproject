Hello, I'm Michael Sherlin. 
I began my career as an apprentice at Renault Nissan Automotive India Pvt Ltd. 
Unfortunately, due to a skin allergy, I transitioned from mechanical engineering to computer networking. 
I served as a Network Engineer at Apollo Hospital in Bangalore for 2.9 years, followed by 2 years at AJ Computer in Nagercoil. 
Additionally, I underwent training in PHP, SQL, and web development at Galaxy Technology Park in Nagercoil, 
and completed a course in React JS.
